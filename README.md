Bread Board Foundry crafts intuitive software solutions that speak the language of hardware engineering. Founded by industry veterans who understand the challenges of turning ideas into reality, we're turning our own engineering frustrations into practical tools that help hardware teams build remarkable products faster.

Our team combines deep hardware expertise with an obsession for crafting exceptional user experiences. Based in the US but collaborating with teams globally, we're excited to help hardware innovators everywhere navigate the journey from concept to creation with ease.

We believe powerful software doesn't need to be complicated or expensiveâ€”it just needs to be thoughtfully designed by people who've lived and breathed the same challenges you face every day.

We're constantly tinkering and iterating to find new ways to simplify the complexities of bringing hardware products to life. From your first prototype to full-scale production, our tools are here to support you every step of the way.
